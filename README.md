- 👋 Hi, I’m @PeboCode, a junior high schooler who plans on studying computer science in college.
- 👀 I’m interested in lots of stuff. I won't restrain myself from learning anything, and there's nothing I want to learn especially, or atleast more than anything else atm!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning asyncio with python (I know, it's some basic stuff lol)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, really. I don't know why you would want a noob like me to collab with your projects,
          but if you hmu I'll definitely work with you on anything! Sounds fun.
- 📫 How to reach me pebosmailbox@gmail.com (I don't check super often, sorry if I'm slow to respond if I'm not expecting anything)
